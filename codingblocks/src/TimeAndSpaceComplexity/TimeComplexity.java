/*linear search, factorial --> O(n)
* binary-search--> O(log n)
* bubble-sort, insertion-sort, selection-sort-->O(n*n)
* Merge sort is better than bubble,insertion, election
* merge-sort, quick-sort--> O(n log n)
* loop inside loop-->(n*n)
*
* loop inside loop inside loop-->O(n*n*n)
* fibonacci-->O(2^n) i.e exponentialc
*
* time complexity of putting an element at end in ArrayList --> O(1) i.e constant
* but if we have to insert element at a particular index then it is O(n)*/
